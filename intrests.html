                    <h3>Computer Science</h3>
                    <p>
                        I am particularly interested in algorithms research, their practical applications, and improvements. 
                        I am expanding my knowledge in machine learning algorithms, focusing on how they can be optimized for real-world problems. 
                        I also enjoy exploring the intersections between theoretical computer science and practical applications in 
                        areas such as software engineering and distributed systems. With a passion for continuous learning, I constantly try to find challenging algorithmic problems

                    <h3>Mathematics</h3>
                    <p>
                        I study graph theory, probability and statistics, and mathematical analysis, which are crucial for 
                        understanding and optimizing algorithms. Additionally, I am exploring areas such as number theory and combinatorics, as they have important applications in fields like cryptography, data security, and network design. Mathematics, for me, provides the necessary foundation to understand the logic 
                        and structure behind algorithms and computational models.
